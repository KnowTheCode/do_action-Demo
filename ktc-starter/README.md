# WordPress Starter Plugin

This repo is the starter plugin for [KnowTheCode.io](https://knowthecode.io). Come check out the [Let’s Build a WordPress Starter Plugin](https://knowthecode.io/labs/lets-build-wordpress-starter-plugin) lab, where you will build this custom plugin with [Tonya](https://knowthecode.io/about) as she explains each step.

You will use this plugin to build labs with us and test constructs in the [Docx](https://KnowTheCode.io/docx).

## Features

This plugin includes the following features:

1. [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/) - Dependency Manager for PHP
2. [Kint](http://raveren.github.io/kint/) - Awesome package that helps you to debug - forget `var_dump` and `print_r`. You are going to love Kint.
3. [Whoops](https://github.com/filp/whoops) - Oh man, you will wonder why this isn't built into PHP. When an error occurs, this displayer replaces out the PHP orange table and gives you information you can actually use.
