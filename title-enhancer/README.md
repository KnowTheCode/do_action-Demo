# Title Enhancer Plugin

This repo is a testing demo plugin for [KnowTheCode.io](https://knowthecode.io). You use it to test getting the instance of an object for things such as unregistering action and filter events.

## Installation
Make sure you run `composer install` in terminal to bring in the dependencies and install Composer locally.

The font icons used are from ionicons.  You will need to make sure they are enqueued in your theme by doing:

`wp_enqueue_style( 'ionicons', '//code.ionicframework.com/ionicons/2.0.1/css/ionicons.min.css', array(), CHILD_THEME_VERSION );`
